        <p> <strong> Hundessa (Oromo: Hacaaluu Hundeessaa;</strong> 1985 â€“ 29 June 2020) was an Ethiopian singer, songwriter, and protestor.</p>
           <p> Hachalu Hundessa was born in <strong><em>Ambo,</em></strong> Ethiopia to Gudatu Hora and Hundessa Bonsa. His family is Oromo and he grew up singing in school clubs and while tending cattle.
            When Hundessa was 17 years old in 2003, he <strong><em>was arrested</em></strong> for taking part in protests and sentenced to prison. He was imprisoned at Karchale Ambo for five years and was later released in 2008.
            Hundessa composed the melodies and wrote most of the lyrics of his first album while he was in prison. His first album, Sanyii Mootii, was released in 2009. In 2013, he toured the United States and released his second album, Waa'ee Keenyaa, which was the #1 best-selling African music album on Amazon.</p>

            </ul>
            <p> Hundessa's protest songs unified the <strong><em>Oromo</em></strong> people, encouraging them to resist oppression. His songs have been closely linked with the anti-government resistance that started in 2015 and the 2016 Ethiopian protests. His ballad "Maalan Jira" ("What existence is mine") concerned the displacement of Oromo people from Addis Ababa. Months after the single was released in June 2015, protests opposing the Addis Ababa Master Plan occurred throughout the Oromia Region. The song became an anthem for protesters and became one of the most viewed Oromo music videos.</p>

            <p class="warning"> In December 2017, Hundessa sang at a giant concert in Addis Ababa that raised funds for 700,000 Oromo who were displaced by ethnic violence and was broadcast live by Oromia Broadcasting Network.
            Hundessa's songs captured Oromo hopes and frustrations. According to lecturer Awol Allo, "Hachalu was the soundtrack of the Oromo revolution, a lyrical genius and an activist who embodied the hopes and aspirations of the Oromo public."</p>
